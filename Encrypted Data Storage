1.Data should be encrypted before storing.
2.We use secure co-processor for this pupose.
3.By embedding a SCP into cloud infrastructure we can handle encrypted data efficiently.
4. SCP is tamper resistant hardware capable of limited generalpupose computation.
5. But running the entire sensitive data storage server on the SCP is not feasible.
    (a)They have limited memory and computational power.
    (b)Software running on the SCP must be trusted and verified.
6.We can encrypt the sensitive data sets using random private keys and to alleviate the risk of key disclosure,we can use tamper-resistant
  hardware to store some of the encryption/secryption keys.
7.Attacker cannot know the keys since they are not in the memory.
8.Any attempt bt attacker will clear the co-processor.
9.This will facilitate :
    (a)secure data storage.
    (b)assured information sharing
