1.In this paper the author is discussing security issues in cloud computing and mainly focus in two layers storage layer and data layer.
2.Cloud computing have numerous potential security concerns because it deals with various technology like networks, database,operating system,virtualization,resource scheduling,transaction management,load balancing,concurrency control and memory management.
3.Data security involves encrypting the data and ensuring that appropriate policies are enforced for data sharing.
4.Also,resource allocation and memory management alogs have to be secure.
5.For secure cloud storage management a infrastructure is to be developed which integrates resources from multiple providers to form a massic=ve virtual storage system.
6. A secure query processing algorithms for RDF and SQL(HIVE) data in clouds with an XACML-based policy manager utilizing the Hadoop/mapReduce framework is developed for secure cloud data management.
7.A secure virtual network (VNM) has to be implemented that will create end to end virtual links with the requested bandwidth and a monitor for computing resources for cloud network management.
8. Basically,secure co-processors(SCP) is a tampered-resistant hardware capable of limited general-purpose computation.It performs computations that are completely hidden from the server. SCP clears the internal memory if any tampering is detected.
9.We canâ€™t push entire data storage into SCP because due to tamper-resistant shell they have limited memory and computational power.
10.Also,software running on SCP must be trustworthy.
