1.We have discussed security concerns of cloud.
2.These issues include storage securty,middleware security,data security,network security and application security.
3.our target is to store and manage data securely that is not controlled by the owner of the data.
4.Basically,we are working on smaller problems to solve muh larger problems.
5.These are things we discussed:
   (a)How to secure document that are stored in third party environment?
   (b)How we can use to secure co-processor(SCP) to enhance the security?


6.It is difficult to achieve end-to-end security in cloud computing.
7.Challenge to ensure more secure operations even if some part of cloud fails.
8.For this we need information assurance but mission assurance also.
9.Even if the advesary has entered the system the objective is to thwart the advesary so that the enterprise has time to carry out the missio.
10.So.building trust applications from untrusted components is the goal.
